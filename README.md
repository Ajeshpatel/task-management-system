A full-featured Task Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js with Vite, and Node.js).  
It allows users to register, log in, and manage tasks with full CRUD functionality â€” including filtering, status updates, and detail views. The UI is responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS via CDN.
